# DnD-Character-Sheet

This repo holds my first-ever application in its original HTML/CSS/JQuery state from 2020.

This was my proudest achievement from my Bachelors in IT and has been a pillar of confidence for me in my developer journey. Since this original piece of work, I've gone through numerous roles and contributed to larger companies applications and platforms, and as of today (23/10/23) I have taken it upon myself to recreate it using my newfound skills and knowledge in development. You may find the new project hosted on vercel at [https://dnd-character-sheet-remaster.vercel.app/](https://dnd-character-sheet-remaster.vercel.app/) or the code at my GitHub repo: [DnD_Character_Sheet_Remaster](https://github.com/danriley11/DnD_Character_Sheet_Remaster).
